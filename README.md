To Do List with SQL



## Description

_Duration: 20 hours_

A simple to do list is often overlooked, even more so one with an active database attached to it. I made a to do list using an SQL database to solve that problem! The interface not only stores/deletes your tasks but you have an option to check it off and leave it on your list to see how much you have got done. Enjoy!


## Installation


1. Create a database named `weekend-to-do-app`,
2. The queries in the `tasks.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!
